This folder contains four modules. 
- The first module is called k_means.py. This is used to define the K-means and flexible_kmeans.
- The second module is called non_linear_dim_reduction.py which is used to define the non-linear dimensionality reduction algorithm.
-The third and fourth modules are run_k_means.py and run_non_linear_dim_reduction.py Basically these modules are used to run the algorithms and generate all the figures used in the submission.
