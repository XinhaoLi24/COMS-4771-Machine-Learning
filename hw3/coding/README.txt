This folder contains three modules. 
- The first module is called neural_network_gd_adam.py. This is used to define Layer, Network, and Adam classes.
- The second module is called learn_simple_functions.py which is used to test whether the framework works for relatively simple functions.
The third module is called learn_pattern.py. Basically this module will actually load the image data, use the neural network to learn and predict the pattern of images.
