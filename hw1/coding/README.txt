This folder contains three modules. 
The first module is called preprocessing_featurizing.py. This is mainly used to do preprocessing and featurizing of our data including word stemming and bad of words.
The second module is called classifier.py which includes the naive bayes classifier and nearest neighbor classifier I built from scatch.
The third module is called run.py. Basically this module will actually load the after-processing data, do train test split, and finally trained the classifiers.
